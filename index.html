<section class="Earth">
    <div class="insidecontent">
    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>Why is our planet a special place to support life?</p>
    <p>Because of Earth's proper distance from the sun, liquid water has remained stable in sizable volumes for the majority of the planet's existence. Chemical cycling, such as that which occurs between the planet's interior and oceans due to volcanism and other geological activity, gives life the means to obtain the energy it needs to survive. It also contains the proper chemical components for life, such as carbon and water.</p>
    <p>An oxygenated atmosphere and its magnetic field's ability to shield it from solar radiation are two more elements that have contributed to the evolution of complex life.</p>

    <h2>Nebulae</h2>
    <p>What is special about nebulae?</p>
    <p>A Nebulae is a massive cloud of dust and gas in space. The gas and dust released by a dying star's explosion, like a supernova, is the source of some nebulae (more than one nebula). New star formation is taking place in other nebulae. Some nebulae are referred to as "star nurseries" because of this. Nebulas are vast clouds of gas and dust in space, often serving as the birthplace of stars. They come in various shapes and colors, creating stunning cosmic landscapes.</p>

<section class="Galaxy">
    <div class="insidecontent">
    <h2>Galaxy</h2>
    <p>For what reason is the galaxy unique?</p>
    <p>Supermassive black holes, some of which have billions of times the mass of the Sun, are found at the core of the majority of massive galaxies. Galaxies are known for a variety of shapes, including spirals, ellipticals, and less ordered ones that are typically referred to as irregular. The majority of galaxies are between 10 and 13.6 billion years old. Galaxies are massive systems of planets, stars, and other celestial bodies that are held together by gravity. They vary from irregular to spiral in size and shape.</p>
